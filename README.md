<h2>Testing</h2>
For this project I conducted the following types of testing:
•	Functional testing
•	Usability testing
•	Cross browser testing

Manual testing was conducted on the website. The website was tested across all major browsers(Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer). The website was also tested across different mobile devices.

I observed that some font sizes are not fully displayed in Internet explorer browser. The music player appears enhanced in the internet explorer browser.

A sample test case for user story no. 2 is seen below.

<h4>Feature: As a user, I want to book the rock band to play at an event</h4>

<h4>Scenario: Booking for an event via the 3Brothers website.</h4>

1.	As a user, navigate to the Booking section via the quick link in the footer or via the Booking navigation tab.
2.	Complete the mandatory field with the details of the booking.
3.	Ensure all the mandatory fields are provided with the specified. information.
4.	Submit the input and confirm a new form is presented.

Cross browser tests reveal some differences in the display of the certain font, for example, the bold font applied to the quick links header in the footer section did not display properly.

The embedded audio elements on the music.html page appeared enhanced on the internet explorer browser and the events page appears to load quicker on the internet explorer browser.
